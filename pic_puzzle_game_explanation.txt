 I am building a pic puzzle game. in the game an image is divided into multiple squares. and the squares are randomized. I mean, the top left part/square of the image might not be at the right place and might be at bottom right. player can select on squares and move them. it will be on a grid. The grid will have one extra area where will be no square. that makes the game playable for user. user can make use of the empty area to move squares around and reach the goal of getting all squares in their respective correct positions on grid, making the full correct image.
